# Install

### Pre-built executable&#x20;

[release](https://github.com/Equationzhao/g/releases)

### Build from source

g is written in Golang, so if you want to build g your self, you should have go1.20 (or later) installed.

```bash
go install -ldflags="-s -w -v"  github.com/Equationzhao/g@latest
```

make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`

### Via package manager

#### Archlinux

#### home-brew tap

```sh
brew tap equationzhao/core git@github.com:Equationzhao/homebrew-g.git
```

```bash
brew install g-ls
```

#### Windows scoop&#x20;

```powershell
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Equationzhao/g/master/scoop/g.json
```

```powershell
# upgrade
scoop uninstall g # uninstall first scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Equationzhao/g/master/scoop/g.json
# error msg like this can be ignored

### Validate Installation&#x20;

use `g -v` to check version

```bash
g -v # check version
```

you should see output like this:
